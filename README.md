# Data
The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dfydata/the-online-plain-text-english-dictionary-opted) is taken from kaggle. I have truncated character count and Part of Speech columns. 

The table just has word and definition columns :
| Word        | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| w1          | d1          |
| w2          | d2          |
