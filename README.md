# Inspiration

The project is inspired from the following [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/g4ct1l/what_are_some_good_resources_to_practice_sql/)

# Data
The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dfydata/the-online-plain-text-english-dictionary-opted) is taken from kaggle. I have truncated character count and Part of Speech columns. 

The table just has word and definition columns :
| Word        | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| w1          | d1          |
| w2          | d2          |

# Project Structure
The project is structured with lots of files
- [data](https://github.com/IshanDave1/dictionary-SQL-Analysis/tree/main/data) : contains data required in this project
- [sql_scipts](https://github.com/IshanDave1/dictionary-SQL-Analysis/tree/main/sql_scipts) : contains different sql scripts used in this project
- [script_output](https://github.com/IshanDave1/dictionary-SQL-Analysis/tree/main/script_output) : If a script produces an output the output is stored here as a csv file, the name of the script and output is the same. Output all_data_sample_query.csv corresponds to all_data_sample_query.sql.
